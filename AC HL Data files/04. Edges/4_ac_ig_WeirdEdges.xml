Bullets and even artillery fragments seem to whizz right by you, especially when you are doing your duty and commanding your men. If your character is standing and not in cover, roll a die for every successful attack that would wound him (including area effect attacks). If the die roll is odd, the hero takes no damage. Otherwise he is affected normally." compset="Edge" uniqueness="useronce">

<thing id="edgACRadr" name="Radar" description="Maybe your hero has a sixth sense. Or maybe he just has really keen hearing. Either way, his squad mates have learned to hit the deck when he does. The soldier can somehow anticipate incoming area effect attacks such as artillery, tank rounds, and even thrown grenades. When caught in an area effect attack, he automatically goes to ground. Since cover modifiers count as armour against area effect attacks, the warrior gets +2 points of armour against the blast. Better still, allies who have been around the character for a while, and who have not acted when the attack hits, get an Agility roll to hit the dirt as well." compset="Edge" uniqueness="useronce">

Not only do you occasionally pick up random radio messages, but you have even figured out how to change frequencies! Radio Head grants the character the ability to pick up radio chatter within a 1 mile radius. Make a Smarts roll when attempting to “tune in”. Failure results in a severe headache (Fatigue) that lasts for 1d6 hours. Success means that the soldier picks up on nearby radio chatter, though it is up to the Game Master as to exactly what he overhears." compset="Edge" uniqueness="useronce">
