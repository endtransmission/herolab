<thing id="edgACCdo" name="Commando" description="Commandos tackle the toughest missions on the front, often operating behind enemy lines with little chance of coming home. Due to the invariably tricky circumstances they find themselves in, commandos need to be mentally sharp to stay ahead of the enemy. This applies to British Commandos, Ghurkas, Long Range Desert Group, SAS, US Army Rangers and Marine Raiders, and other similar elite soldiers. Commandos add +2 to all Fatigue rolls made against environmental hazards (including cold and heat), sleep deprivation, foot marches, and add +2 to all Survival rolls. As much of their work involves getting close to their targets for a silent takedown, they receive a +1 to Stealth rolls. All of these bonuses are cumulative with those derived from other Edges." compset="Edge" uniqueness="useronce">

<thing id="edgACFrog" name="Frogman" description="Navy frogmen are highly skilled, tough, and motivated. Their primary job is underwater demolitions. Whether their targets are beach obstacles, mines, or enemy ships, frogmen can remove, defuse, or blow them sky high. When supporting beach landings, they make maps, do hydrographic surveys, and prepare obstacles for demolition so that the beach is as clear as possible for the main landing force. They can also find themselves planting explosives on ships at anchor in enemy harbours. Their training is as rigorous as any commando. Swimming rolls for frogmen are made at +2, and Pace is improved by +1”. These bonuses are cumulative with those offered by other Edges. Creatures with the Aquatic special ability do not get their +2 attack bonus against Frogmen." compset="Edge" uniqueness="useronce">
