Outstanding issues for resolution:
-
1) On Hold - Every time Dementia exceeds Sanity we need to increment Sanity by 1 permanently - Need to work out how to create a hidden placeholder field.
2) Translating mythos tomes - hinACMTam - How do we add a knowledge skill if they do not already have one?
3) Translating mythos tomes -  hinACMTam - If Knowledge(Mythos) is added when the translation has already been completed, then it gains 2 upgrades instead of one.
4) How do we handle magic?!!
5) Review all skills and edges to include adjustments to rolls - See thing_edges.dat - Ace edge as example.
6) Add vehicle weaponry
7) Finish vehicles from GM book
8) Bennies come up twice in the tracker. How do we change the output text for this?


Injuries
1) injACExhau - 2 levels of exhaustion
2) 

Edge issues
1) edgACCBoy - Check that at least 4 skill points have been spent on Smarts skills
2) edgACGrzl - Increase character rank by 1
3) edgACMExp - Increase sanity by 1 - increment hidden dementia field in sanity by 1-3D6
4) edgACGrzF - Shooting D8
5) edgACRNco - Pick requirement of military rank
6) edgACCdo - +2 to survival rolls; +2 to environmental fatigue; +1 Stealth - all cumulative with other skills
7) edgACCoUF - Should have one of the two Ranks; Rank(NCO) or Rank(Officer)
8) edgACInIn - Check for one of Habit, Phobia or Quirk

Weapon issues
1) wpACM12S - Damage is listed as 1-3D6? This will cause negative damage?!

Hindrances
1) Fix minor and major shellshock D1/D2 reference - can't remember what this is in reality

-
Questions
-
1) Should Improved Bullseye have a prerequisite of Bullseye?
2) 

-
Usage
-

Sanity - The character's Sanity is based upon the Spirit value. The In-Play tab allows the addition of Dementia points. Sanity loss needs to be added as an Injury. Each occurance of Sanity Loss is -1 Sanity.
