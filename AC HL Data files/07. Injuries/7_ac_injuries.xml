<thing id="injACAddi" name="Addiction" description="Drinking is the way in which many of those shocked and battered by their experiences deal with their mental pain and stresses. A few become addicted to morphine, though dousing one’s troubles in alcohol is far more common during World War Two. While these things ease the pain, they also create powerful cravings for more to keep the demons at bay. The investigator gains the Habit (Major) Hindrance." compset="Injury">

<thing id="injACBlst" name="Bloodlust" description="This investigator has killed more than his fair share, and many times he was close enough to look into his enemy’s eyes. The experience has awakened a strange lust within him. This investigator has the Bloodthirsty Hindrance, but with a difference. If he is unable to kill in hand-to- hand combat every seven days, he becomes dangerously mean until his bloodlust is sated." compset="Injury">

<thing id="injACfls" name="Flashbacks" description="Not only is the investigator Panicked, but when things really go bad he is overwhelmed by images of past battles and dead comrades. In a combat situation images flash through his mind, confusing the past with reality. A normal hero draws two cards per round and acts on the worst of the two. Heroes with the Level Headed Edge draw just one card to act on; those with the Improved version draw only two cards, and act on the best one. This can be brought under control for the current battle through a Spirit check at -4." compset="Injury">

Whether it is religion, a lucky rabbit’s foot, or a picture of his sweetheart carried inside his helmet liner, the investigator finds something that helps him deal with the terrors he faces. Pick a simple routine or object to be the focus of this disorder. As long as the focus is undisturbed, he can function normally.
