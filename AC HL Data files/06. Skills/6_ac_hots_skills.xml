<thing id="skACPara" name="Parachuting" description="Under normal circumstances, parachuting requires a successful Agility (-1) roll to land safely; failure requires a further subsequent successful Agility roll, or the investigator suffers a level of Fatigue which persists until they receive successful medical treatment, or have rested for more than 6 hours. Investigators trying to land close to a populated area at night without alerting guards (within a mile or so) must also make a Stealth roll to avoid being spotted on the descent; doing the same by day means the investigator is automatically spotted." compset="Skill">

</thing><thing id="skACDream" name="Dreaming" description="All investigators start with d4 in Dreaming. They have been manipulating their own dreams for their whole lives, albeit unknowingly. Dreaming is used to alter Dreamlands reality and can only be performed if the user is asleep and dreaming. The dreamer chooses, consciously or unconsciously, what it is he creates. He may make something small, such as a piece of fruit, or he may achieve something wonderful. The creation process may take a single dream and a Dreaming roll to complete, or it may take many separate creative efforts, many dreams and much time. If the dream\'s creative impulse comes from the dreamer\'s subconscious, the GM may decide what is created in whole or in part. Creations normally are not a threat to the Dreamer (for example, his subconscious would not dream up a Deep One to attack him), unless he is insane at the time of course. The more complex or large the item the investigator wishes to create, the larger the penalty to the Dreaming roll. See below for a list of suggested cumulative penalties: Living: -4; Mechanical: -4; Each size +1/-1; Richly decorated: -2" compset="Skill">
